# RetroPie romfilter

This application is designed to let you browser the
list of ROMs you have installed for each of your systems on
a RetroPie. You can quickly filter your lists to search
for specific details or even delete ROMs
(move them to a trash folder).

You CAN run this application directly on a RetroPie, but
you might not be pleased with the performance. Instead, I prefer to
run RetroPie romfilter on another machine on the same network.
