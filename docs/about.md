I was inspired to write this application after playing with
[RetroPie-Manager](https://github.com/botolo78/RetroPie-Manager) .
See my FAQ for why I started this app.

This application is designed to let you browse and filter the list of ROMs you have installed
across all of your systems on your RetroPie.

Features include
* Filtering and sorting your the details of your ROMs in nearly any way you can imagine
* Delete individual ROMs

You *can* run this directly on a your RetroPie if you install Oracle Java 8,
**but at this time I don't recommend it** unless you are prepared to reduce the memory provided to romfilter
and accept the risk that the reduced system memory might keep games from running.
I don't know how much memory these emulators require. I'd love some advise on this.

I currently run romfilter on another machine on the same network
and configure it to communicate with my RetroPie using the SMB shares
RetroPie automatically creates.
